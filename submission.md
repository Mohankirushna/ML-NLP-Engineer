- **Pooling**: [CLS] token representation for classification

### 3. Training Strategy
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Batch size: 16
  - Learning rate: 2e-5
  - Epochs: 3
  - Optimizer: AdamW
  - Weight decay: 0.01
- **Regularization**:
  - Dropout (default BERT)
  - Gradient clipping

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
