# Video Script: ML-NLP-Engineer Project Walkthrough

## Introduction (0:00-0:30)
"Welcome to our IMDB Sentiment Analysis project! In this video, I'll walk you through our implementation of a DistilBERT-based sentiment classifier. We'll explore the project structure, key files, and demonstrate how everything works together."

## Project Overview (0:30-1:00)
*Show the README.md*
"Our project is organized into several key directories. We have the source code in `src/`, notebooks for exploration, saved models, and comprehensive reports. The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using state-of-the-art NLP techniques."

## Source Code (1:00-2:30)
*Navigate to src/ directory*
"Let's look at the core components:

1. `config.py` - Contains all configuration parameters
2. `data_preprocessing.py` - Handles loading and preprocessing the IMDB dataset
3. `model_utils.py` - Contains model architecture and utilities
4. `train_model.py` - Main training script
5. `evaluation.py` - Handles model evaluation and metrics

The main entry point is `train.py` in the root directory, which ties everything together."

## Training Process (2:30-3:30)
*Show training command*
"To train the model, we simply run:
```bash
python train.py
```

This script:
1. Loads and preprocesses the IMDB dataset
2. Initializes the DistilBERT model
3. Trains with our specified parameters
4. Saves the best model and evaluation metrics"

## Model Architecture (3:30-4:15)
*Show model configuration*
"We're using DistilBERT, a lightweight version of BERT with 6 layers instead of 12. The model takes in tokenized text and outputs sentiment probabilities. We use the [CLS] token representation for classification."

## Results (4:15-5:00)
*Show reports/model_report.md and visualizations*
"Our model achieves:
- 87.44% accuracy
- 87.43% F1 score
- Balanced performance across classes

The confusion matrix shows we're doing particularly well with clear positive/negative sentiment, with some challenges in nuanced cases."

## Demo (5:00-5:45)
*Run a sample prediction*
"Let's see it in action! We can load our trained model and make predictions on new reviews. For example:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 
                     model='models/trained_model',
                     tokenizer='tokenizer')
result = classifier("This movie was absolutely fantastic!")
print(result)  # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.98}]
```

## Future Work (5:45-6:15)
*Show future_work.md or README section*
"Some exciting directions we're considering:
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific data
- Implementing model distillation for even faster inference
- Adding multi-lingual support
- Building a REST API for easy integration"

## Conclusion (6:15-6:30)
"Thanks for watching! This project demonstrates how modern NLP can be applied to real-world sentiment analysis. The code is well-documented and ready for extension. Check out our GitHub repository for more details and feel free to contribute!"
