# üé§ ML-NLP-Engineer Project - 5-Minute Talk Script

## üü¢ Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

Hello everyone! Today, I‚Äôll be walking you through my NLP project titled **IMDB Sentiment Analysis**. This project is built using **DistilBERT**, a lighter and faster version of BERT. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. We‚Äôll explore how the project is structured, the core files and scripts, how the model is trained, and finally, the results and future improvements.

## üìÅ Project Overview (0:30 - 1:00)

The project is organized into several key folders:

* `src/`: where all the core source code resides
* `notebooks/`: contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation
* `models/`: holds trained model weights and tokenizer configuration
* `reports/`: stores evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and JSON reports
* `tokenizer/`: has the tokenizer vocab and config files

We also have important standalone files like `train.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`. The project uses the IMDB dataset to train a binary sentiment classifier with DistilBERT at its core.

## üß† Source Code Walkthrough (1:00 - 2:30)

Let‚Äôs look at the core components inside `src/`:

* `config.py`: defines configuration variables like batch size, learning rate, model paths, etc.
* `data_preprocessing.py`: handles loading the IMDB dataset and applying tokenization using Hugging Face‚Äôs tokenizer.
* `model_utils.py`: sets up the DistilBERT model and its classification head. It also includes helper functions for saving and loading the model.
* `train_model.py`: this is the core training loop. It handles optimizer setup, batching, model training, and checkpointing.
* `evaluation.py`: after training, this script is used to evaluate the model and save metrics like F1 score, accuracy, and the confusion matrix.

The main entry point is `train.py`, located in the root directory. It integrates all these components and can be executed directly to train and evaluate the model.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training Process (2:30 - 3:30)

To train the model, you simply run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script does the following:

* Loads the IMDB dataset from Hugging Face Datasets
* Applies the tokenizer
* Initializes the DistilBERT model
* Trains for a fixed number of epochs
* Evaluates the model on validation data
* Saves the model and tokenizer config

Everything is designed to be reproducible and modular.

## üß¨ Model Architecture (3:30 - 4:15)

We‚Äôre using **DistilBERT**, which retains 97% of BERT‚Äôs performance but is 40% smaller and 60% faster. The model uses the `[CLS]` token output from the transformer to make a binary classification. It's optimized for both performance and resource efficiency. Tokenization is handled using `AutoTokenizer` from Hugging Face.

---

## üìä Results & Demo (4:15 - 5:00)

After training, the model achieved:

* **Accuracy:** 87.44%
* **F1 Score:** 87.43%

Evaluation artifacts include a confusion matrix and a metrics report in JSON format. These can be found in the `reports/` directory.

Here‚Äôs a quick demo of making a prediction:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 
                      model='models/trained_model',
                      tokenizer='tokenizer')
result = classifier("This movie was absolutely fantastic!")
print(result)  # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.98}]
```

---

## üöÄ Future Work (Optional Extension)

We‚Äôre considering:

* Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets (e.g., finance or medical)
* Adding multilingual support
* Serving the model via a REST API
* Applying model distillation for ultra-fast inference

## üéâ Conclusion (5:00 - 5:15)

This project demonstrates the practical application of modern NLP tools for sentiment classification. It‚Äôs lightweight, modular, and production-ready. You can check out the full codebase on GitHub and feel free to contribute or fork it for your own use.

## ü§ù Final Note (5:15 - 5:30)
It was a truly rewarding experience working on this project. Exploring state-of-the-art NLP techniques with real-world data helped deepen my understanding of model optimization and deployment. I genuinely enjoyed collaborating on this topic and would love to continue working with you on more exciting projects in the future. Thank you once again!
 Thank you!
