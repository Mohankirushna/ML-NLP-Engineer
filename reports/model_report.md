## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Data-Level**
   - Collect more training data, especially for underrepresented classes
   - Apply data augmentation techniques
   - Address class imbalance if present

2. **Model-Level**
   - Try different pre-trained models (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa)
   - Adjust learning rate and batch size
   - Implement learning rate scheduling
   - Try different sequence lengths

3. **Training**
   - Increase number of epochs with early stopping
   - Implement gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes
   - Try different optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD with momentum)
